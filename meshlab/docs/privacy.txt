MeshLab will automatically check for the availability of updated versions
and will notify the need of upgrading the software to the users. For this
reason, from time to time, MeshLab will issue a http network connection.

If you prefer that MeshLab does not communicate in any way with its
developers, simply use a plain firewall to prevent any MeshLab access to
the network.

When using the MeshLab system some aggregated statistical data about the
specific usage of MeshLab itself, is collected and periodically this
information is sent back to the developers. This information will not
specifically identify users and the information will be used internally
for statistical analysis only and will not be published or made available
for general access without an explicit consensus.

We would like to remark that the kind of information collected by MeshLab
is probably by far less sensitive than the information that is silently
collected by most web sites when you surf them: ip address, visited pages,
frequency of return. We would also like to stress that we really need this
information in order to assess how diffusely MeshLab is used.

Thanks for your patience
The Developers.
