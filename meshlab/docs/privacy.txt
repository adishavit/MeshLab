Please read it carefully.

When using the MeshLab system certain information about its use, such as
IP addresses and some statistical data, are
collected. This information will not specifically identify users and the
information will be used internally for statistical analysis only and will not be
published or made available for general access without an explicit consensus.

If you prefer that MeshLab does not send back any kind of information simply
use a plain firewall to prevent MeshLab access to the network.

We should like to remark that the kind of information collected by MeshLab
is probably less than the information that is silently collected by most
web sites when you surf them, ip address, visited pages, frequency of
return...
