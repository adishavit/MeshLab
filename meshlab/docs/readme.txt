--- Synopsis ---

MeshLab, a mesh processing system, aimed to the user assisted cleaning, filtering,
editing and rendering of unstructured 3D triangular meshes like the ones that usually
arise in 3d scanning. The system is heavily based on the VCG library (vcg.sf.net). 
Please, when using this tool, cite the following reference:

--- General Info ---

An extendible system for the user assisted processing of  unstructured meshes. 
The system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured models
arising in 3d scanning, providing a set of tools for cleaning and healing this kind of meshes.
The system is heavily based on the VCG library developed at the Visual Computing Lab of ISTI - CNR,
for all the core mesh processing task. The Meshlab system started as a part of the FGT course of the
Computer Science department of University of Pisa.
