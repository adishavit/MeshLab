MeshLab Release Note

** Every Time you commit something significant add a few lines here. 
** Be Descriptive please. 


2014 04 08 Corrected Selection Bug. 
Old and low-end graphics cards (like the integrated intel ones) do not support OpenGL selection modes. Re-implemented all the selection using a internal pipeline that is actually faster.

2014 04 18 New MeshLabServer version has been committed
MeshLabServer is now able to properly manage the MeshLab Project files. MeshLabServer has been completely rewritten in order (hopefully) to enhance the robustness and usability of the tool 

2014 04 25 Improved on screen Help. 
Now it reports the trick for quick visibility toggling in the Layer window.

2014 04 28 Corrected Missing Preview Bug
The preview check box disappeared from many filters that were changing just the geometry of the mesh (like all the smoothing filters) without any serious reason.

2014 04 30 Improved selection-by-quality filters
Now they consistently works also for point clouds. 

2014 04 30 Improved Computation of normals for point clouds
In the case of working with point clouds generated with the well known Bundler, we added the options to reorient the vertex normals to comply with the cameras in Bundler datasets that have a camera attribute 

2014 05 06 Obj File Export. 
Added support of polygonal meshes in OBJ  output. Now meshes with faux edges set are correctly exported as polygonal meshes (and not tris)

2014 05 07 OFF File Import
Corrected bug in the faux edge setting when loading polygonal meshes.
