Generates craters onto a mesh using radial functions.<br />
There must be at least two layers to apply this filter:<br />
<ul>
    <li>the layer that contains the target mesh;</li>
    <li>the layer that contains the samples which represent the central points of craters.</li>
</ul>

The Gaussian radial function is used as basis for the outline of craters.
